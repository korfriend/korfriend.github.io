We possess extensive expertise in the installation and application of diverse sensor devices for industrial vision solutions, as well as in conducting various experimental studies. 
1. Quality Control: Using high-resolution cameras and sensors, we can detect defects that might be invisible or hard to detect by the human eye. This is particularly useful in industrial manufacturing, textiles, and food processing. We have experience in **analyzing various imaging data obtained from optical camera system to the x-ray system, creating successful commercial SW solutions**.
2. 3D Imaging: 3D vision systems can provide data on an objectâ€™s height, volume, or profile. This is crucial in checking volume of filled products and ensuring the correct fit of industrial parts. We have experience in **reconstructing CT volume data from x-ray scan images, generating depth map from vari-focal images or multi-view images, and configuring their explicit mesh models**.
3. Argumented Reality: Based on our experiences for diverse sensor controls, we can overlay 3D virtual models aligned along the human-vision images, enhancing the intuitive understanding of human operations. We have experience in **conducting a large-scale government-supported AR project, where we have successfully developed an efficient AR tracking and calibration system to integrate data scanned from various devices into a single image**.
