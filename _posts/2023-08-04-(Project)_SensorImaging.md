Our Expertise in Industrial Vision Solutions

We specialize in the end-to-end implementation of advanced industrial vision solutions, from sensor installation and application to rigorous experimental validation. Our core capabilities include:

1. Automated Quality Control
We leverage high-resolution cameras and sensor arrays to detect microscopic defects and anomalies that are imperceptible to the human eye. This capability is critical for enhancing quality and yield in sectors like industrial manufacturing, textiles, and food processing.

Proven Experience: We have successfully developed commercial software solutions by analyzing a wide spectrum of imaging data, ranging from optical camera systems to industrial X-ray scanners.

2. High-Precision 3D Imaging & Analysis
Our 3D vision systems provide precise data on an objectâ€™s geometry, including height, volume, and surface profile. This is essential for applications such as verifying the fill volume of products or ensuring the precise fit of mechanical components.

Proven Experience: We are proficient in reconstructing 3D CT volumes from X-ray scans, generating accurate depth maps from multi-view or vari-focal images, and constructing explicit mesh models for analysis and simulation.

3. Augmented Reality (AR) for Industrial Applications
Leveraging our deep expertise in multi-sensor control, we develop AR solutions that overlay 3D virtual models onto a user's real-world view. This provides intuitive, real-time guidance for complex assembly, maintenance, and operational tasks.

Proven Experience: We successfully led a large-scale, government-funded AR project, delivering a high-performance tracking and calibration system. This system efficiently integrates and visualizes data from multiple sensors into a single, unified augmented view.
