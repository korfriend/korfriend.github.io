Based on our technological development experience in computer graphics and computer vision, we have been developing mixed reality applications that offer the ultimate immersion and researching the underlying technologies. By integrating various sensor data provided by immersive HMDs with external sensor data to track the human actions and real environment, then projecting the tracking things onto the virtual environment, we aim to provide a high-quality immersive mixed reality experience.

To this end, we are leveraging artificial intelligence technology for user interaction through media to develop:

1. A plugin that efficiently controls the hyper-realistic rendering effects provided by the Unreal Engine and the high-quality human resource, MetaHuman,
2. A hyper-realistic user-reactive AI agent utilizing audio recognition and the LLM AI modules,
3. An immersive on-site content creation and sharing system using NeRF technology,

Based on the understanding of the above technologies, our laboratory has been conducting projects for **immersive exposure therapy content with [Seoul National University Dental Hospital, Prof. HyunJeong Kim](https://dentbio.snu.ac.kr/research/lab/dal/)**, and **immersive diagnostic examinations content with [HALLYM UNIV. MEDICAL CENTER](https://research.hallym.or.kr/hallym_hit/hallymuniv_sub.asp?screen=ptm140)**.
